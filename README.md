# WColumn

## A Command Line Application To Keep Track of Your W's In Life!

+ We tend to turn our accomplishments in life and turn them into negatives when compared to others so I made this app (inspired by Dr. K: https://twitter.com/HealthyGamerGG/status/1615857210638180353?s=200) to hold your W's and make them viewable so any time you need to look how far you've come you can do it!

+ Features include everything you'd expect from a notes app such as:
  + Importing
  + Editing
  + Deleting
  + Viewing of past notes
  + And of course the essential: Animations!
